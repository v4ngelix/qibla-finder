# Find Qibla
A suckless web map application for finding Qibla.
Built as a personal light-weight research tool,
but maybe useful for other people as well.

## TODO:
* Maplibre and Google raster on a globe view?
* Google maps
* Deck.gl:
  * Scenegraph layer - 3d mecca.
  * Line layer, between you and mecca.
* For mobile, allow mobile positioning if possible.
